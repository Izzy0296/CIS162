  <p>My name is Isai Xuncax, this is my second semester at Cerritos College. I am pursuing my computer science degree and excited to take this class. I love to travel and have been to Europe a few times. Some of the places I had a chance to visit were Germany, London, and Amsterdam. I have a pug and her name is Lilo. I have taken a web development bootcamp which led me to pursue this career and field.</p>
